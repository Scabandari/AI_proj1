This program is written in Python 3 so, under linux, just cd into the directory
containing all the code and run:
python3 main.py

DFS almost never finds a solution so the program may run indefinitely but before DFS starts
the other algos should have already output out their solution .txt files.

If there are any .txt files, other than the README, in the folder you can delete them. They will be
recreated by the program
